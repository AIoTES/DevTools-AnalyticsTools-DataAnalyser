1. General operation
================================================================================

Data loading
---------------------------------

To load a local file, browse a file from the panel at the left side and click
"Upload".


Raw data table
---------------------------------

Once a file is loaded, the loaded data are presented in a table. The table is 
paginated. You can view more pages from the navigation buttons at the bottom.
The rows can be sorted according to the values of a specific column by clicking
on the name of the column.

You can specify how many rows to show per page from the select box at the 
top-left of the table. The default is 10 rows per page.

You can search for a specific value in the table by writing the value, or part
of it, in the search box at the top right of the table. As soon as you begin 
typing, the table is filtered accordingly.


Data analytics method selection
---------------------------------

Once a data file has been loaded, the "Select analysis" panel is shown at the
right side of the screen. It displays the categories of data analytics methods
supported.

In each category, a select box allows the user to select a specific method from
the corresponding category.


Data analytics method configuration and running
---------------------------------

Once a data analytics method is selected from one of the categories, the
method's configuration panel is presented to the right. Each method has its own
parameters that the user needs to specify before calling the method.

Once the parameters are set, the user can click on the "Run" button
in order to run the method and view the results.


Data analytics results table
---------------------------------

After the user runs a data analytics method, the results appear in a table
below the raw data table. The user can navigate in this table in a similar
manner as in the raw data table.


Export data analytics results
---------------------------------

After the user runs a data analytics method, he/she can export the results to
a file in a specified format.

At the right side of the screen, below the method parameters, there is the 
"Export results" area. The user must select one of three currently supported 
formats:
- CSV
- JSON
- NVD3 JSON

The NVD3 JSON format is JSON with a bit modified structure, in order to be
readily used in visualizations using the NVD3 library.

After the user selects an output format, he/she can click on the "Export
results" button to download the data. The data are downloaded to a file named
"results", with an extension dependent on the selected format.



2. Demo scenarios
================================================================================

k-means clustering
---------------------------------

- Load the "xy_data.json" file. The raw data contain rows of x and y values.
- From the "Clustering" category, select the "k-means" method.
- In the k-means options panel, specify the following parameters:
    * Attributes to use: Both the "x" and "y" attributes 
      (Ctrl + click for multiple selection).
	* Number of clusters: 3
- Click "Run".
- The results are presented in the "Analytics results" area under the raw data.
  The output table is similar to the raw data, with the addition of the 
  "clusterLabel" column, which is the label of the cluster in which each row
  belongs. The cluster labels range from 0 to the number of clusters selected
  minus 1. By viewing more pages of the results, you can see which rows belong
  to which clusters.
- Change the number of clusters from 3 to 2 and click "Run" again.
- The results table is updated. Now the data are split in two clusters.


Local Outlier Factor anomaly detection
---------------------------------

- Load the "xy_data.json" file. The raw data contain rows of x and y values.
- From the "Anomaly detection" category, select the "LOF" method.
- In the LOF options panel, specify the following parameters:
    * Attributes to use: Both the "x" and "y" attributes 
      (Ctrl + click for multiple selection).
	* Number of neighbors: 3
- Click "Run".
- The results are presented in the "Analytics results" area under the raw data.
  The output table is similar to the raw data, with the addition of the 
  "anomalyScore" and "anomalyLabel" columns. The anomaly score is a number 
  showing how much outlier a specific row is. The larger the anomaly score, the
  more outlier a row is considered. The anomaly label is a qualitative 
  assessment of each row as "Regular" or "Outlier", based on the anomaly score
  and a pre-defined threshold. By viewing more pages of the results, you can 
  see more rows of the results.


Histogram feature extraction
---------------------------------

- Load the "activity_data.json" file. The raw data contain rows of 
  activity-related data (which room the user was at at a specific time).
- From the "Feature extraction" category, select the "Histogram" method.
- In the histogram options panel, specify the following parameters:
    * Each entity is a: userID
	* Compute histogram based on: room
- Click "Run".
- The results are presented in the "Analytics results" area under the raw data.
  Each row of the results corresponds to a userID (the entity of interest).
  For each user, a histogram is computed, based on the values of the "room"
  attribute for this user. The histogram for a user shows which the frequency
  of visits of the user in each of the rooms. Such features can be used e.g.
  for computing behavioural similarities among users.


Summary statistics
---------------------------------

- Load the "luminance_data.json" file. The raw data contain values of luminance
  at specific timestamps.
- From the "Feature extraction" category, select the "Summarization" method.
- In the summarization options panel, specify the following parameters:
    * Attribute: value
- Click "Run".
- The results are presented in the "Analytics results" area under the raw data.
  There is only one row, containing several summary statistics for the selected
  column (the attribute).
